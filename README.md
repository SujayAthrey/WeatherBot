# WeatherBot

A twitter bot which has the function of displaying a detailed weather report of a random city in NJ at that given day factoring in the current time as well.
The bot is capable of sending out tweets that include present-day statistics like the sunrise and sunset, temperature, conditions, wind speed, and humidity.
Sourced factual, real-time statistics about the current weather and conditions at different New Jersey cities using the Weather API provided by OpenWeather
Used the Twitter API v2 along with the OAuth 2.0 authorization in order to get permission to post tweets under my bot account. Then accessed, parsed, and retrieved necessary information my bot needed from the JSON formatted data received from my Weather API requests.

**ALL TWITTER AND OPENWEATHER API KEYS/ACCESSTOKENS STORED IN A HIDDEN .ENV FILE TO BE ACCESSED PRIVATELY IN WEATHER_BOT.PY**
